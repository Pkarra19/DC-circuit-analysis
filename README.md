# ENGR108-Matlab-Project
You have been assigned by an electronics manufacturer to analyze the circuit shown below. The component with a resistance of 100 ohms can only safely carry a current of 0.5mA before failing. The system is powered by a 9V battery.

## 2.1 Objective
Find the current through each component in the system, and check to make sure the selected component will not fail.
## 2.2 Tips for solving
* Use Kirchhoff's voltage and current rules to construct the system of linear equations.
* Label each component and assume a direction for each current that passes through it.
* If a voltage loop goes in the direction opposite the current through a resistor, add the voltage instead of subtracting it.
* Check that your voltage loops and current nodes cover all the components in the circuit.
* Use a loop or a node that you didn't use in your system of equations to check your answer.
